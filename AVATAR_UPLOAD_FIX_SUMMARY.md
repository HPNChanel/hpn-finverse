# Avatar Upload Fix Summary

## 🐛 **Issue Identified**
The avatar disappeared immediately after upload due to improper state management in the Profile component:

1. **State Management Issue**: `setAvatarPreview(null)` was clearing the preview before the new avatar URL was properly set
2. **Caching Issue**: No cache-busting mechanism to prevent browser caching of old avatar images  
3. **Timing Issue**: Race condition between `refreshUser()` and avatar display
4. **No Optimistic Updates**: The UI didn't immediately show the uploaded avatar

## ✅ **Fixes Implemented**

### 1. **Enhanced State Management**
```typescript
// Added dedicated avatar state management
const [avatarUrl, setAvatarUrl] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [avatarTimestamp, setAvatarTimestamp] = useState<number>(Date.now());

// Update local state immediately after upload
if (response.avatar_url) {
  setAvatarUrl(response.avatar_url);
  setAvatarTimestamp(Date.now()); // Force cache bust
}
```

### 2. **Cache-Busting Implementation**
```typescript
const getAvatarSrc = () => {
  if (avatarPreview) return avatarPreview;
  
  if (avatarUrl) {
    // Add cache-busting timestamp to prevent caching issues
    const separator = avatarUrl.includes('?') ? '&' : '?';
    return `${avatarUrl}${separator}t=${avatarTimestamp}`;
  }
  
  return undefined;
};
```

### 3. **Optimistic Updates**
- **Immediate State Update**: Avatar URL is set immediately after successful upload
- **Preview Management**: Only clear preview after confirming upload success
- **File Input Reset**: Clear file input to prevent re-submission

### 4. **Enhanced Avatar Component**
```tsx
<AvatarImage 
  src={getAvatarSrc()}
  alt={user.name || user.email}
  key={avatarTimestamp} // Force re-render when timestamp changes
/>
```

### 5. **Avatar Refresh Feature**
Added manual refresh button with loading state:
```typescript
const handleRefreshAvatar = async () => {
  setIsAvatarLoading(true);
  try {
    await refreshUser();
    setAvatarTimestamp(Date.now()); // Force cache bust
    toast({ title: "Avatar Refreshed", ... });
  } catch { ... }
};
```

### 6. **Layout Consistency**
Updated MainLayout to use the custom `useAvatarUrl` hook for consistent avatar handling across the app.

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Frontend State Flow**
1. **File Selection** → Show preview
2. **Upload Trigger** → Set loading state
3. **API Call** → Upload file to `/users/me/avatar`
4. **Immediate Update** → Set `avatarUrl` and `avatarTimestamp`
5. **Clear Preview** → Remove preview since we have the real image
6. **Refresh Context** → Sync with user context
7. **Cache Bust** → Force browser to load new image

### **Backend Implementation**
- **File Validation**: Type and size checking
- **Unique Filenames**: `{user_id}_{uuid}{extension}`
- **Database Update**: Save relative URL `/uploads/avatars/{filename}`
- **Static Serving**: Files accessible at `GET /uploads/avatars/{filename}`

### **Cache-Busting Strategy**
- **Query Parameters**: Add `?t={timestamp}` to force browser refresh
- **Key Prop**: Use timestamp as React key to force component re-render
- **Timestamp Updates**: Refresh timestamp on upload and manual refresh

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**

### **Basic Functionality** ✅
- [ ] Upload image shows preview before upload
- [ ] Upload button works and shows loading state
- [ ] Avatar appears immediately after successful upload
- [ ] Avatar persists after page reload
- [ ] File validation works (type and size)

### **Edge Cases** ✅  
- [ ] Upload different image types (jpg, png, gif, webp)
- [ ] Upload oversized files (should fail with proper error)
- [ ] Upload non-image files (should fail with proper error)
- [ ] Cancel upload works properly
- [ ] Multiple rapid uploads don't break state

### **Cache-Busting** ✅
- [ ] Upload new avatar overwrites old one visually
- [ ] Manual refresh button updates the avatar
- [ ] Browser back/forward doesn't show cached old avatar
- [ ] Hard refresh shows latest avatar

### **UI/UX** ✅
- [ ] Loading states show properly during upload
- [ ] Toast notifications appear for success/error
- [ ] Avatar appears in navbar after upload
- [ ] Avatar appears in profile page
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile

### **Integration** ✅
- [ ] Avatar shows in MainLayout dropdown
- [ ] Avatar shows in StakingLayout (if applicable)
- [ ] Profile update doesn't affect avatar
- [ ] Password change doesn't affect avatar

## 🚀 **How to Test**

### **Manual Testing Steps**
1. **Navigate to Profile page** (`/profile`)
2. **Click camera icon** to select image
3. **Choose an image file** (jpg/png recommended)
4. **Verify preview appears** with Upload/Cancel buttons
5. **Click Upload** and verify loading state
6. **Confirm avatar appears** immediately after upload
7. **Reload page** and verify avatar persists
8. **Check navbar dropdown** to see avatar there too

### **Test Different Scenarios**
```bash
# Test file validation
- Upload a .txt file (should fail)
- Upload a 10MB image (should fail)
- Upload a very small image (should work)

# Test cache-busting
- Upload avatar A
- Upload avatar B (should replace A immediately)
- Click "Refresh Avatar" button
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)

# Test navigation
- Upload avatar
- Navigate to different page
- Come back to profile
- Check navbar dropdown
```

## 🔍 **Debugging Info**

### **Browser Developer Tools**
```javascript
// Check if avatar URL has cache-busting param
console.log(document.querySelector('img[alt*="avatar"]')?.src);
// Should show: "/uploads/avatars/1_abc123.jpg?t=1703123456789"

// Check user context has avatar_url
console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user')));
```

### **Network Tab**
- **Avatar Upload**: `PUT /api/v1/users/me/avatar` should return 200
- **Profile Fetch**: `GET /api/v1/users/me` should include `avatar_url`
- **Static File**: `GET /uploads/avatars/{filename}` should return image

### **Common Issues & Solutions**
| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Avatar disappears | State cleared too early | Fixed in `handleAvatarUpload` |
| Old avatar cached | No cache-busting | Added timestamp query param |
| Upload fails | File validation | Check file type/size |
| 404 on avatar | Static serving issue | Check FastAPI static mount |
