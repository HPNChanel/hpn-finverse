# Unstake ETH Feature Implementation

## 🎯 Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the "Unstake ETH" feature for FinVerse, allowing users to withdraw their staked ETH after the lock period expires.

## 🧱 Components Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes

#### Database Model Updates (`finverse_api/app/models/stake.py`)
- ✅ Added `unstaked_at` column to track when stake was withdrawn
- ✅ Added `unstake_tx_hash` column to store unstake transaction hash
- ✅ Added `UNSTAKED` status to `StakeStatus` enum
- ✅ Updated `to_dict()` method to include new fields

#### API Schema Updates (`finverse_api/app/schemas/staking.py`)
- ✅ Added `UnstakeSyncRequest` schema for unstake synchronization
- ✅ Added `UnstakeSyncResponse` schema for unstake response
- ✅ Updated `StakeResponse` schema to include unstake fields

#### New API Endpoint (`finverse_api/app/routers/staking.py`)
- ✅ Added `POST /staking/unstake-sync` endpoint
- ✅ Validates stake ownership and unlock status
- ✅ Prevents duplicate unstake transactions
- ✅ Updates stake status and creates log entry
- ✅ Returns detailed response with transaction info

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### New Components
- ✅ `UnstakeButton.tsx` - Smart button component that:
  - Shows lock status with countdown tooltip
  - Displays enabled unstake button for unlocked stakes
  - Shows "Unstaked" badge for already unstaked positions
  - Handles all UI states (locked, unlocked, unstaked)

- ✅ `UnstakeModal.tsx` - Complete unstake flow modal:
  - Shows stake summary and confirmation details
  - Integrates with MetaMask for blockchain transaction
  - Handles all transaction states (confirm, pending, success, failed)
  - Syncs with backend after successful blockchain transaction
  - Provides transaction links to Etherscan

#### Service Updates (`finverse_ui/src/services/stakingService.ts`)
- ✅ Added `unstakeETH()` method for backend synchronization
- ✅ Updated `StakeProfile` interface to include unstake fields

#### Integration
- ✅ Integrated `UnstakeButton` into `StakePositionCard.tsx`
- ✅ Full-width button placement for optimal UX

### 3. Smart Contract Integration
- ✅ Uses existing `unstake(uint256 stakeIndex)` function in `StakeVault.sol`
- ✅ Validates stake ownership and lock period on-chain
- ✅ Returns staked ETH + earned rewards to user wallet

## 🔄 User Flow

### Unstake Process
1. **User sees staking position** with UnstakeButton
2. **If locked**: Button shows disabled with countdown tooltip
3. **If unlocked**: Button shows active "Unstake" button
4. **Click Unstake**: UnstakeModal opens with stake details
5. **Confirm transaction**: User reviews amount, rewards, and warnings
6. **MetaMask interaction**: User confirms blockchain transaction
7. **Transaction pending**: Modal shows progress with Etherscan link
8. **Backend sync**: Successful transaction syncs with database
9. **Completion**: User sees success message and updated stake status

### States Handled
- ✅ **Locked stakes**: Disabled button with countdown
- ✅ **Unlocked stakes**: Active unstake button
- ✅ **Already unstaked**: Status badge display
- ✅ **Transaction pending**: Loading state with progress
- ✅ **Transaction failed**: Error handling with retry option
- ✅ **User cancellation**: Graceful handling of cancelled transactions

## 🛡️ Security & Validation

### Backend Security
- ✅ User authentication required
- ✅ Stake ownership verification
- ✅ Duplicate transaction prevention
- ✅ Lock period validation
- ✅ Database transaction rollback on errors

### Frontend Security
- ✅ MetaMask integration for secure transactions
- ✅ Transaction hash validation
- ✅ Error handling for all failure scenarios
- ✅ User confirmation flow with warnings

### Smart Contract Security
- ✅ Existing battle-tested contract functions
- ✅ Lock period enforcement
- ✅ Stake ownership validation
- ✅ Reentrancy protection (from existing contract)

## 📊 Database Schema

### Stakes Table Updates
```sql
ALTER TABLE stakes ADD COLUMN unstaked_at DATETIME NULL COMMENT 'When the stake was withdrawn';
ALTER TABLE stakes ADD COLUMN unstake_tx_hash VARCHAR(100) NULL UNIQUE COMMENT 'Unstake transaction hash';
```

### Status Values
- `ACTIVE` - Stake is currently earning rewards
- `UNSTAKED` - Stake has been withdrawn (new)
- `PENDING` - Stake transaction pending
- `COMPLETED` - Stake completed normally
- `CANCELLED` - Stake cancelled

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Visual States
- **Locked**: 🔒 Disabled button with clock icon + countdown tooltip
- **Unlocked**: 🔓 Red "Unstake" button with unlock icon
- **Unstaked**: ⚠️ Gray badge with "Unstaked" text

### Modal Features
- **Clear summary**: Amount, pool, rewards, dates
- **Visual progress**: Loading states with animated icons
- **External links**: Direct links to Etherscan for transactions
- **Error recovery**: Retry functionality for failed transactions
- **Auto-close**: Success modal auto-closes after 2 seconds

### Responsive Design
- ✅ Full-width buttons on mobile
- ✅ Responsive modal sizing
- ✅ Touch-friendly interface
- ✅ Accessible tooltips and descriptions

## 🚀 Bonus Features Implemented

### ✅ Auto-refresh ETH balance
- Stake list refreshes after successful unstake
- Real-time balance updates
- Position status updates

### ⏱ Countdown timers
- Shows days remaining until unlock
- Real-time countdown in tooltips
- Clear lock status indicators

### 📊 Transaction tracking
- Full transaction history in logs
- Etherscan integration for verification
- Detailed transaction status tracking

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Frontend Testing
```bash
# Test locked state
- Verify disabled button for locked stakes
- Check countdown tooltip accuracy
- Ensure proper date calculations

# Test unlocked state  
- Verify enabled unstake button
- Test modal opening/closing
- Validate stake summary display

# Test transaction flow
- Mock MetaMask interactions
- Test error scenarios
- Verify success state handling
```

### Backend Testing
```bash
# Test API endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/staking/unstake-sync \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"stake_id": 1, "tx_hash": "0x..."}'

# Test validation scenarios
- Invalid stake ID
- Already unstaked stake
- Locked stake (should fail)
- Duplicate transaction hash
```

### Integration Testing
1. Create test stake with short lock period
2. Wait for unlock period
3. Test complete unstake flow
4. Verify database updates
5. Check frontend state changes

## 📋 Deployment Checklist
